<p>Welcome to logview</p>

<p>LogView is a simple web-application whose purpose is to enable watching logfiles 
on servers. It is basically a development tool. It can be used for debugging and
tracing problems. It shouldn't be installed permanently on production environments
(with its default configuration).
It may however, be installed or activated for specific tracing purposes.</p>


<p>Improved LogView is based on Open Source project logview-web hosted at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/logview-web/">
http://code.google.com/p/logview-web/</a>.<br>
This version of application is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/showaid/LogViewWeb.git">
